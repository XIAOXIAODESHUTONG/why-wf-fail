# Why workflow fail?
In the development and release of Internet software today, a standard process has been developed, the most important component of which is continuous integration. Continuous integration requires team members to integrate their work frequently, and each integration is verified by an automated build. But as test files grow in size and number, it becomes a challenge to let members find and understand the causes of errors quickly and accurately. 

### Main goals:
This project aims to use machine learning algorithms and through extensive learning and classification to automatically classify the causes of code errors, allowing programmers to understand the direction and parts of errors as soon as possible. This project will extract a lot of log files of projects on GitHub, and through a lot of analysis and classification make the algorithm can accurately classify the correct cause of errors.

## Getting Started
First you need to clone the entire project code and add your own GitHub token in the token location, and after compiling and running it, it will be ready to use.

### Project Dependencies
- pandas
- requests
- github
- re
- ast
